## AM I SAFE

A webapp under development that can check if you have crossed path with an infected person.

Feel free to raise an [issue](https://github.com/sarathsajan/cross-path-alert/issues) if you find one.

> Hosted at https://pythonanywhere.com


When the user uses the website for the first time, he should see three neat form with option to enter travel place [in coordinates for start can switch to maps in future] travel date and travel time can search

a new intermediate page to register/login/skip email is shown

after providing email he will recieve a otp confirmation and an new page with form to 'enter otp' is displayed

after registration he can login whenever he want with just his email only ( the security issues at this stage is ignored and even if someone uses other persons email its not gonna be a issue since all the spammer can do is add some fake travel log )(security can be increased as the website progress)

after logging with email he should see three neat form with option to enter travel place (in coordinates for start can switch to maps in future) travel date and travel time

the database is manually filled with travel log of patients

if the user has a match instantly he can be notified including colorcoded warnings

or if hew gets a flag later he should be alerted by email and next time he login there should be colorcoded warnings

can update donotreply reminder emails like "do you have cough fever etc etc" for the flagged users and suggest him to 'visit nearest health center if things are not good' as the webapp progress
