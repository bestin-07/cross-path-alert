can see the form for providing email

after registration he can login whenever he want with just his email only [ the security issues at this stage is ignored and even if 
someone uses other persons email its not gonna be a issue since all the spammer can do is add some fake travel log ][security can be 
increased as the website progress]

after logging with email he should see three neat form with option to enter travel place [in coordinates for start can switch to maps 
in future] travel date and travel time
