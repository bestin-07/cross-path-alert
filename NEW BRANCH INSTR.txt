First, you must create your branch locally
git checkout -b your_branch




After that, you can work locally in your branch, when you are ready to share the branch, push it. The next command push the branch to the remote repository origin and tracks it
git push -u origin your_branch



Teammates can reach your branch, by doing:

git fetch
git checkout origin/your_branch



You can continue working in the branch and pushing whenever you want without passing arguments to git push (argumentless git push will push the master to remote master, your_branch local to remote your_branch, etc...)

git push
